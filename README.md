# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Projects Repository
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains all projects that I worked on throughout my journey with ALX. It contains various projects focusing on data analysis, visualizations, and machine learning.
ere's a brief overview of what you'll find:

## Projects Overview:
### 1. Excel Projects:
#### Integrated project 1
#### Understanding the data
##### Description: 
This project involves investigating the access to safe and affordable drinking water.
##### Skills Demonstrated:
Importing and cleaning raw sales data using Excel's data manipulation features.
Designing dashboards using pivot tables, charts, and slicers.
Implementing Excel functions (e.g.ROUND, SUM, QUARTILE, MODE) for data analysis and aggregation.
##### Files:
Estimates-on-the-use-of-water-(2020)-a-3712.csv: Contains the raw data.

Usage:
Open Estimates-on-the-use-of-water-(2020)-a-3712.csv and ensure data is structured correctly.
Open Integrated Project 1.xlsx to explore the report and interact with the data.


#### Integrated project 2
####  Transforming the data
##### Description: 
In this project, I extended my investigation on access to safe and affordable drinking water.
##### Skills Demonstrated:
Importing and cleaning raw sales data using Excel's data manipulation features.
Designing dashboards using pivot tables, charts, and slicers.
Implementing Excel functions (e.g.AVERAGEIFS, COUNTIFS, UNIQUE, VLOOUP) for data analysis and aggregation.
##### Files:
Estimates of the use of water (2000-2020).csv and Regions.csv: Contain the raw data.

Usage:
Open Estimates of the use of water (2000-2020).csv and Regions.csv and ensure data is structured correctly.
Open Integrated Project 2.xlsx to explore the report and interact with the data.


### 2. SQL
This project involves analyzing a movie database to extract insights such as popular genres, actor collaborations, and box office performance.

#### Skills Demonstrated:
Crafting SQL queries to extract relevant information from a movie database.
Utilizing aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT) to calculate metrics such as average ratings, total revenue, and movie counts.
Implementing SQL joins to combine data from multiple tables (e.g., movies, genres, actors).
Creating views to encapsulate frequently used queries and simplify data access. 

#### Files:
TMDB.db file: Contains the raw movies data

#### Usage
Open the SQL Exam notebook and ensure your database is stored in the same location as the notebook
